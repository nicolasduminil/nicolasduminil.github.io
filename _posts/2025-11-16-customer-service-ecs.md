In a three articles series published recently on this site ([Part 1](https://dzone.com/articles/aws-cdk-infrastructure-as-abstract-data-types),
[Part 2](https://dzone.com/articles/aws-cdk-infrastructure-as-abstract-data-types-pt-2), [Part 3](https://dzone.com/articles/aws-cdk-infrastructure-as-abstract-data-types-3)),
I've been demonstrating the power of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) in the
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) area, especially when coupled with the ubiquitous
Java and its supersonic / subatomic cloud-native stack: Quarkus.

While focusing on the CDK fundamentals in Java, like `Stack` and `Construct`,
together with their Quarkus implementations, this series was a bit frugal as far
as the infrastructure elements were concerned. Indeed, for the sake of the clarity
and simplification, the infrastructure used to illustrate how to use the CDK with
Java and Quarkus was inherently consensual. Hence, the idea of a new series, of
which this article is the first one, a series less concerned by CDK internals
and more dedicated to the infrastructure itself.

This first article demonstrates how to build and deploy a modern, cloud-native
customer management system using Quarkus, AWS CDK, and ECS/Fargate. It covers
the complete journey from application development to infrastructure as code,
containerization and comprehensive testing strategies. Once again, it doesn't
emphasise on the exposed API and its possible business value, but rather on the
infrastructure elements required in order to provide the global solution in practice.

## Architecture Overview

The diagram below shows an overview of the project's architecture:

![Architecture Diagram](/assets/images/architecture.png)

This presented solution implements the following architecture layers:
  - Presentation Layer : A Quarkus REST API exposing, as an example, a couple of simple customer management endpoints.
  - Application Layer : A Quarkus main application running on ECS Fargate
  - Data Layer : PostgreSQL (RDS) for persistence, Redis (ElastiCache) for caching
  - Infrastructure Layer (Iaas): The AWS CDK-managed cloud infrastructure implemented in Quarkus

Let's try now to look in more details at these layers.

### The Presentation Layer

This layer is a Quarkus REST API which exposes a couple os simple endpoints to
CRUD customers. More than a real business API, this one is an example allowing
to illustrate how containerized applications could be deployed and hosted in an
AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).

In order to separate concerns, our Maven project is structured in two modules:

  - the `customer-service-ecs-api` module which implements the Quarkus REST API to be deployed and executed as a Docker image in the AWS ECS service;
  - the `customer-service-exce-cdk` module which bootstraps the CDK and creates the required elements in order to implement the cloud infrastructure presented in the figure above.

The Presentation Layer is contained in the `customer-service-ecs-api` module.
The exposed REST API is simple and consists in the following endpoints to CRUD
`Customer` entities:

  - `GET /customers`: returns a response containing the list of the currently existent customers;
  - `POST /customers`: creates a new customer by persisting the entity passed in the request's body;
  - `PUT /customers/{id}`: updates the existent customer having the ID equal to the one passed as the `id` parameter. If such a customer doesn't exist then HTTP 404 is returned.
  - `GET /customers/{id}`: returns a response containing the customer having the ID equal to the one passed as the `id` parameter. If such a customer doesn't exist then HTTP 404 is returned.
  - `DELETE /customers/{id}`: deletes the customer having the ID equal to the one passed as the `id` parameter. If such a customer doesn't exist then HTTP 404 is returned.

The endpoints above are implemented in the class `CustomerResource` which is a
CDI (Context Dependency Injection) bean, annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`. This
is a very realistic example of using CDI in AWS deployed infrastructure elements.

### The Application Layer

This layer is the "brain" of the system, the place where the actual customer
management business logic resides, separated from how it is exposed by the
presentation layer. In our project it is included in the module `customer-service
-ecs-api` as well and it consists in:

  - the `Customer` entity which is the domain model representing the business object;
  - the `CustomerService` class containing the core business logic to CRUD operations;
  - the caching strategies using Redis;
  - the transaction management;
  - the business rules and validation logic;

We mentioned precedently that the `CustomerResource` class, as the pilar of the
presentation layer, is a CDI bean and, as such, it injects another CDI bean, the
`CustomerService` class, which performs the effective CRUD operations on `Customer`
business objects, using Quarkus Panache. The listing below shows the `Customer`
entity:

    @Entity
    @Table(name = "customers")
    public class Customer extends PanacheEntity
    {
      @NotBlank
      public String firstName;
      @NotBlank
      public String lastName;
      @Email
      @NotBlank
      public String email;
      public String phone;
      public String address;

      public Customer(){}
      ...
    }

As you can see, the validation rules are expressed using Jakarta Validation
constraints.

Given this very simplified representation of a customer, the `CustomerService`
class uses the `PanacheEntity` methods to CRUD customers, as shown below:

    @ApplicationScoped
    public class CustomerService
    {
      @Inject
      RedisDataSource redisDS;

      @Transactional
      public Customer create(Customer customer)
      {
        customer.persist();
        invalidateCache("customers:all");
        return customer;
      }

      public List<Customer> findAll()
      {
        return Customer.listAll();
      }

      public Customer findById(Long id)
      {
        ValueCommands<String, Customer> cache = redisDS.value(Customer.class);
        Customer cached = cache.get("customer:" + id);
        return Optional.ofNullable(cached).orElseGet(() -> {
          Customer customer = Customer.findById(id);
          if (customer != null)
            cache.setex("customer:" + id, 300, customer);
          return customer;
        });
      }

      @Transactional
      public Customer update(Long id, Customer updates)
      {
        return Optional.ofNullable((Customer) Customer.findById(id))
          .map(customer ->
          {
            customer.updateFrom(updates);
            invalidateCache("customer:" + id);
            invalidateCache("customers:all");
            return customer;
          })
          .orElse(null);
      }

      @Transactional
      public boolean delete(Long id)
      {
        boolean deleted = Customer.deleteById(id);
        if (deleted)
        {
          invalidateCache("customer:" + id);
          invalidateCache("customers:all");
        }
        return deleted;
      }

      private void invalidateCache(String key)
      {
        redisDS.key().del(key);
      }
    }

Nothing very spectacular here, just an usual Quarkus Panache service to CRUD
customers. As you can see, the transaction management that we mentioned previously
are implemented on the behalf of the `@Transactional` annotation provided by
the Jakarta Transaction specification, implemented by Quarkus.

The application layer isn't directly invoked but through the API endpoints, in the
`CustomerResource` class, for example:

      ...
      @POST
      public Response create(@Valid Customer customer)
      {
        return Response.status(Response.Status.CREATED)
          .entity(customerService.create(customer)).build();
      }
      ...

The endpoint above is invoked through HTTP by a REST client and, in turn, it calls
`CustomerService`. And talking about REST clients, we also provide a MicroProfile
(MP) REST Client, which aims at facilitating the integration, by giving the API
consumers an easy and practical way to invoke it. Look at the interface
`CustomerClient` below:

    @RegisterRestClient(configKey = "customers-api")
    @Path("/customers")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public interface CustomerClient
    {
      @POST
      Response createCustomer(Customer customer);
      @GET
      @Path("/{id}")
      Response getCustomer(@PathParam("id") Long id);
      @GET
      public Response getCustomers();
      @PUT
      @Path("/{id}")
      Response updateCustomer(@PathParam("id") Long id, @Valid Customer customer);
      @DELETE
      @Path("/{id}")
      Response delete(@PathParam("id") Long id);
    }

For those not yet familiar with the MP REST Client specification and its Quarkus
implementation, this interface is all you need in order to probe your API. I'll
come back later to it when we'll discuss testing.

Let's look now at the infrastructure layer.

### The Infrastructure Layer

This layer makes the object of the 2nd project's module: `customer-service-ecs-cdk`.
It consists of a Quarkus main class, named `CustomerManagementMain`, shown below:

    @QuarkusMain
    public class CustomerManagementMain
    {
      public static void main(String... args)
      {
        Quarkus.run(CustomerManagementApp.class, args);
      }
    }

This class is the entry point class that bootstraps the Quarkus CDK application.
It uses `@QuarkusMain` to define the main method and delegates to Quarkus runtime
to run the `CustomerManagementApp` class, shown below;

    @ApplicationScoped
    public class CustomerManagementApp implements QuarkusApplication
    {
      private CustomerManagementStack customerManagementStack;
      private App app;

      @Inject
      public CustomerManagementApp (App app, CustomerManagementStack customerManagementStack)
      {
        this.app = app;
        this.customerManagementStack = customerManagementStack;
      }

      @Override
      public int run(String... args) throws Exception
      {
        Tags.of(app).add("project", "Containerized Customer Management Application on ECS/Fargate");
        Tags.of(app).add("environment", "development");
        Tags.of(app).add("application", "CustomerManagementApp");
        customerManagementStack.initStack();
        app.synth();
        return 0;
      }
    }

This class is the main application class, as opposed to the Quarkus main class.
It orchestrates the CDK stack creation by:

The main application class implementing QuarkusApplication. It orchestrates the CDK stack creation by:

  - injecting the CDK App and CustomerManagementStack via CDI;
  - adding global tags to the CDK app for project identification;
  - initializing the stack infrastructure;
  - synthesizing the CloudFormation templates;

The class `CustomerManagementStack`, too long to be reproduced here, defines the
CDK stack to be deployed. This stack consists in the following AWS infrastructure:

  - a VPC (*Virtual Private Cloud*) with a public and a private subnet across multiple AZs (*Availability Zone*);
  - a NAT (*Network Address Translation*) gateway to outbound the internet access for private resources;
  - an RDS (*Relational Database Service*) with a PostgreSQL database with automated backups and secrets' management;
  - a Redis cluster using AWS ElastiCache for in-memory caching and performance optimization;
  - an ECS (*Elastic Container Service*) Fargate serverless container hosting platform;
  - an ALB (*Application Load Balancer*) for the traffic distribution and health checking;
  - a Secrets Manager for the secure credential store and rotation;
  - all the required security groups and network level access control;
  - a CloudWatch log group for monitoring;
  - the required IAM (*Identity and Access Management*) roles for the fine-grained permission management;

The Java CDK provides the familiar pattern Builder which makes easy to instantiate
complex structures and class hierarchies. The code excerpt below provides an example:

        ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService fargateService =
          ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService.Builder.create(this, "CustomerService")
            .cluster(cluster)
            .cpu(config.ecs().cpu())
            .memoryLimitMiB(config.ecs().memoryLimitMiB())
            .desiredCount(config.ecs().desiredCount())
            .taskImageOptions(ApplicationLoadBalancedTaskImageOptions.builder()
              .image(ContainerImage.fromRegistry(imageName))
              .containerPort(containerPort)
              .logDriver(LogDriver.awsLogs(AwsLogDriverProps.builder()
                .logGroup(logGroup)
                .streamPrefix(config.logging().streamPrefix())
                .build()))
              .environment(Map.of(
                "QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL",
                  "jdbc:postgresql://" + database.getInstanceEndpoint().getHostname() +
                  ":5432/" + config.database().databaseName(),
                "QUARKUS_REDIS_HOSTS", "redis://" + redis.getPrimaryEndpoint() + ":6379"
              ))
              .secrets(Map.of(
                "QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME",
                  Secret.fromSecretsManager(database.getSecret(), "username"),
                "QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD",
                  Secret.fromSecretsManager(database.getSecret(), "password")
              ))
              .build())
            .publicLoadBalancer(true)
            .healthCheckGracePeriod(Duration.seconds(config.ecs().healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds()))
            .serviceName(config.ecs().serviceName())
            .minHealthyPercent(100)
            .build();

This code sequence uses different builders in order to instantiate a full ECS
Fargate serverless hosting platform. Given the high number of parameters that
this process requires, the `InfrastructureConfig` interface, here below, provides
a type-safe Quarkus `@ConfigMap`.

    @ConfigMapping(prefix = "cdk.infrastructure")
    public interface InfrastructureConfig
    {
      VpcConfig vpc();
      EcsConfig ecs();
      DatabaseConfig database();
      RedisConfig redis();
      LoggingConfig logging();
      interface VpcConfig
      {
        @WithDefault("2")
        int maxAzs();
        @WithDefault("1")
        int natGateways();
      }
      interface EcsConfig
      {
        @WithDefault("256")
        int cpu();
        @WithDefault("512")
        int memoryLimitMiB();
        @WithDefault("2")
        int desiredCount();
        @WithDefault("60")
        int healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds();
        @WithDefault("customer-service")
        String serviceName();
      }
      interface DatabaseConfig
      {
        @WithDefault("BURSTABLE3")
        String instanceClass();
        @WithDefault("MICRO")
        String instanceSize();
        @WithDefault("customers")
        String databaseName();
        @WithDefault("postgres")
        String secretUsername();
        @WithDefault("false")
        boolean deletionProtection();
      }
      interface RedisConfig
      {
        @WithDefault("cache.t3.micro")
        String nodeType();
        @WithDefault("1")
        int numNodes();
        @WithDefault("customer-cache")
        String clusterId();
        @WithDefault("Redis cache for customer service")
        String description();
      }
      interface LoggingConfig
      {
        @WithDefault("/ecs/customer-service")
        String logGroupName();
        @WithDefault("ONE_WEEK")
        String retentionDays();
        @WithDefault("ecs")
        String streamPrefix();
      }
    }

This `@ConfigMap` defines nested configuration structures for different
infrastructure components and `@WithDefault` annotations for default values and
provides compile-time configuration validation while organizing settings into
logical groups like VPC, ECS, database, Redis, and logging.

## CDK Configuration and Deployment

AWS CDK uses the `cdk.json` file as its primary configuration mechanism to define
how the CDK application should be executed and deployed. This file serves as the
entry point that tells the CDK toolkit how to run the infrastructure application.

Here below is the file `cdk.json` used for this project:

    {
      "app": "java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar",
      "context": {
        "aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail": true,
        "@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:minHealthyPercent": true
      },
      "requireApproval": "never",
      "output": "cdk.out",
      "progress": "bar",
      "ci": true,
      "verbose": false,
      "acknowledgements": {
        "@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:ecrImageRequiresPolicy": true,
        "@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:minHealthyPercent": true,
        "34892": true
      },
      "notices": false
    }

Looking at this file, several categories of key aspects are to be brought into
focus:

  - The `app` element: defines the command which executes the application. Our application being a Quarkus one, the `app` element reflects that by defining the standard way to run a Quarkus JVM application.
  - The `context` element: stores environment specific settings. In our case:
    - `"aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail": true` controls the behavior of the `cdk diff` command such that to continue the execution even if it encounters errors, for example missing permissions to describe resources, etc.
    - `"@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:minHealthyPercent": true` is an ECS specific flag that enables the `minHealthyPercent` property for ECS services. Here, it allows setting the minimum percentage of healthy tasks during deployments (e.g., 50% for rolling updates).
  - The feature flags: control CDK behavior and enables/disables specific features. In our case:
    - `"requireApproval": "never"` says that the CDK will never prompt for manual approval during `cdk deploy` operations.
    - `"output": "cdk.out"` sets the directory where the CloudFormation templates, generated by the `cdk synth` command, will be stored.
    - `"progress": "bar"` shows progress bar during CDK operations instead of detailed logs.
    - `"ci": true` optimizes output for CI/CD environments (less interactive, more structured).
    - `"verbose": false` suppresses detailed debug information during execution.
    - `"notices": false` disables CDK notices about new features or deprecations.
  - The acknowledgements:
    - `"@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:ecrImageRequiresPolicy": true` acknowledges that ECR images require IAM policies for access;
    - `"@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:minHealthyPercent": true` confirms understanding of ECS health check behavior
    - `"34892": true` acknowledges specific CDK issue/warning (likely related to a GitHub issue number)

This `cdk.json` file is used by the CDK toolkit to:

  - Synthesis: execute the app command to generate CloudFormation templates in `cdk.out`.
  - Deployment: use the synthesized templates to deploy infrastructure to AWS.
  - Context Management: cache AWS account/region specific information for consistent deployments.

## Running and testing

There are several test categories that come with the project, as follows:

  - integration tests;
  - system integration tests;
  - Open API / Swagger tests;
  - end-to-end tests.

As you can see, we don't provide unit tests because we think that this category
of tests is completely useless. But this is another topic which doesn't belong
to the scope of this article.

### The Integration tests

These tests aim at testing the complete REST API layer with the Quarkus runtime.
They use the test infrastructure automatically provide by the Quarkus Dev Services
with an in-memory H2 database, in order to validate the API contracts, the
requests/responses and the business logic integration.

The class `CustomerResourceTest` is one test in this category. It is executed
by the `maven-surefire-plugin` in the Maven test phase, hence its naming
convention: `*Test`.

    @QuarkusTest
    public class CustomerResourceTest
    {
      @Test
      void testCreateCustomer()
      {
        given()
          .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
          .body("""
            {
              "firstName": "John",
              "lastName": "Doe",
              "email": "john@example.com"
            }
          """)
          .when()
          .post("/customers")
          .then()
          .statusCode(201)
          .body("firstName", equalTo("John"));
      }
      ...
    }

We reproduced here only one test method, the one creating new customers. Feel
free to extensively look at this class which uses the RESTassured library as
REST client.

Another integration test is the class `CloudFormationTemplateIT`. As opposed to
the previous one, this class is executed by the `maven-failsafe-plugin` in the
Maven `verify` phase. The reason is that it needs to be run after the `cdk synth`
command, executed by the `exec-maven-plugin`. This command synthesizes the required
AWS infrastructure in the form of a CloudFormation template, stored in the directory
`cdk.out`. Then the test class checks the files in this directory for the presence
and the validity of these AWS infrastructure elements.

In order to perform the integration test:

    $ cd aws-cdk-quarkus
    $ mvn clean verify

The Maven command above will execute, in addition to the integration tests, the
system integration tests.

### The System Integration Tests

These tests are a more realistic version of the integration ones. As opposed to
the former ones, which were relying on a Quarkus runtime related infrastructure,
these tests are more realistic in the sense that they are performed against a
local, while production similar, containerized infrastructure. During the Maven
`verify` phase, the `exec-maven-plugin` executes the `docker-compose.yaml` file against
the currently running Docker daemon and starts all the required services, as follows:

  - a PostgreSQL database;
  - the `adminer` tool to administrate the database;
  - a Redis node for in-memory caching purposes;
  - the `redis-insight` tool to administrate the local Redis instance;
  - the customer management API as a Quarkus application.

Once all this infrastructure is started, the `CustomerResourceIT` class uses the
`CustomerClient` to test the API running locally. The usage of the MP REST Client
isn't mandatory, of course, other REST clients, like RESTassured or simply Jakarta
REST Client, can be used. However, the MP REST Client is, in my opinion, the
simplest and the most effective solution.

    @QuarkusTest
    @TestProfile(IntegrationTestProfile.class)
    public class CustomerResourceIT
    {
      @Inject
      @RestClient
      CustomerClient customerClient;

      @Test
      void testCreateCustomer()
      {
        Customer customer = new Customer("John", "Doe", "john@example.com",
          "000000000000", "123 Main St");
        Response response = customerClient.createCustomer(customer);
        assertThat(response.getStatus()).isEqualTo(201);
        customer = response.readEntity(Customer.class);
        assertThat(customer.firstName).isEqualTo("John");
        assertThat(customer.lastName).isEqualTo("Doe");
        assertThat(customer.email).isEqualTo("john@example.com");
      }
      ...
    }

As you can see, the test is using a Quarkus customized profile, named
`IntegationTestProfile`, shown below:

    public class IntegrationTestProfile implements QuarkusTestProfile
    {
      @Override
      public Map<String, String> getConfigOverrides()
      {
        return Map.of(
          "quarkus.datasource.db-kind", "postgresql",
          "quarkus.datasource.username", "nicolas",
          "quarkus.datasource.password", "dev123",
          "quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url", "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/customers",
          "quarkus.datasource.devservices.enabled", "false",
          "quarkus.redis.hosts", "redis://localhost:6379",
          "quarkus.redis.devservices.enabled", "false"
        );
      }
    }

### The Swagger tests

The module `customer-service-ecs-api` exposes a Swagger interface that you can
use to manually test the API. Just fire your preferred browser at
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui and you'll be presented with that:

![swagger](/assets/images/swagger.png)

This will allow you to probe your API.

### The E2E Tests

The last test category is the end-to-end one. These tests have the particularity
to be performed against the real AWS services (ECS, RDS, ElasticCache, etc.).
The class CustomerServiceE2EIT is such a test. It's similar to the integration
test `CustomerResourceTest` in the sense that it uses RESTassured to probe the
API but, instead of invoking local endpoints, it invokes endpoints onto the real
API deployed on the AWS Fargate platform and executed as a Docker image.

Everything happens in the code sequence below:

      @BeforeAll
      static void setup()
      {
        cfClient = CloudFormationClient.builder()
         .region(Region.EU_WEST_3)
         .build();
        String loadBalancerUrl = getStackOutput("QuarkusCustomerManagementStack", "CustomerServiceLoadBalancerDNS");
        RestAssured.baseURI = "http://" + loadBalancerUrl;
        RestAssured.port = 80;
        System.out.println(">>> Connecting to: " + RestAssured.baseURI + ":" + RestAssured.port);
        waitForServiceReady();
      }

This method orchestrates the connection to teh AWS environment. It creates a
CloudFormation client configured for the EU-WEST-3 region where the infrastructure
is deployed. Then it queries the deployed CloudFormation stack to retrieve the
ALB DNS name, eliminating hardcoded URLs and ensuring tests always connect to
the correct deployed instance. The RESTassured client is configured with the
dynamically discovered ALB URL and the standard HTTP port (80). The remaining
is very similar to what we did in `CustomerResourceTest` and `CustomerResourceIT`.
The method `waitForServiceReady()` is, however, new and ensure the the ECS service
is fully operational before running the tests, preventing this way false failures
due to deployment timing.

To run the E2E tests execute the following Maven command:

    $ cd aws-cdk-quarkus
    $ mvn -Pe2e clean verify

The workflow is as follows:

  1. The module's `pom.xml` file uses the `exec-maven-plugin` to run, in the Maven's `pre-integration-test` phase, the command `cdk synth`. This command creates the associated CloudFormation template in the directory `cdk.out`.
  2. Then the same `exec-maven-plugin` runs, in the same Maven's `pre-integration-test` phase, the script `deploy-ecr.sh` which automates the complete container deployment workflow.
  3. This script creates the ECR (*Elastic Container Repository*) repository if it doesn't exist, using environment variables for dynamic naming and region configuration.
  4. Then it authenticates with ECR, retags the local Docker image with the ECR registry URL, and pushes it to the remote repository.
  5. If the stack already exists, due to a previous execution, then it is updated, otherwise the complete infrastructure is created from scratch.

Here is the script:

    #!/bin/bash
    registry=$CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.$CDK_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com
    echo ">>> Creating ECR registry $registry"
    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $CONTAINER_IMAGE_GROUP/$CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME  --region $CDK_DEFAULT_REGION 2>/dev/null || echo "### Repository already exists"
    echo ">>> Logging into ECR..."
    aws ecr get-login-password --region $CDK_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $registry
    echo ">>> Tagging and pushing existing image..."
    docker tag $CONTAINER_IMAGE_GROUP/$CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME:1.0-SNAPSHOT $registry/$CONTAINER_IMAGE_GROUP/$CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME:latest
    docker push $registry/$CONTAINER_IMAGE_GROUP/$CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME:latest
    echo ">>> Checking if stack exists..."
    if aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name QuarkusCustomerManagementStack --region $CDK_DEFAULT_REGION >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo ">>> Stack exists - updating ECS service ..."
      CLUSTER_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name QuarkusCustomerManagementStack \
        --query 'StackResources[?ResourceType==`AWS::ECS::Cluster`].PhysicalResourceId' \
        --output text --region $CDK_DEFAULT_REGION)
      if [ -n "$CLUSTER_NAME" ]; then
        echo ">>> Found cluster: $CLUSTER_NAME - updating ECS service..."
        aws ecs update-service \
          --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
          --service customer-service \
          --force-new-deployment \
          --region $CDK_DEFAULT_REGION
        echo ">>> Waiting for service update to complete..."
        aws ecs wait services-stable \
          --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
          --services customer-service \
          --region $CDK_DEFAULT_REGION
        echo ">>> Service update complete!"
        exit 0
      fi
    fi
    echo ">>> Deploying full infrastructure..."
    cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
    echo ">>> Deployment finished !"

Beware that the deployment operation is a long-running process which can take
more than 15 minutes. Also, once deployed and running, you'll be invoiced for
the cost of the associated infrastructure.

During the script execution, you can check the progression by running scripts
like `describe-services.sh`, `describe-events.sh`, `describe-stacks.sh`, etc.,
or simply using in the AWS Console to look for possible error messages in the
CloudWatch log groups. In order to run scripts you need to:

    $ cd aws-cdk-quarkus/customer-service-ecs
    $ ./customer-service-ecs-cdk/src/main/resources/scripts/<script-name>

Once the deployed successful and after having exercised your infrastructure,
don't forget to run the `delete-stack.sh` script, which will remove everything
you deployed, avoiding you this way to be invoiced by AWS.

Enjoy !
