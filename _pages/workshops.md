## Resilient event-driven architecture and development using Java and Quarkus

This workshop aims at building-up together all the different aspects of the reactive panorama, such that reactive programming, 
reactive streams, reactive messaging, etc. Here you'll learn how Reactive might help face to the new technological 
concerns like containerisation and cloud. 

The target audience is formed by intermediate and advanced Java developers. While being reasonable confortable with Java
is required in order to take advantage of this workshop, prior knowledge of reactive programming isn't required.

## What will you learn during this workshop ?

  1. Full overview of the reactive landscape
  2. Developing reactive enterprise grade applications with Quarkus (JVM and native executables).
  3. Full overview of K8s and Minikube
  4. The Complexities and the characteristics of reactive applications
  5. The different forms of asynchronous development model with focus on reactive applications
  6. Reactive Java web applications development
  7. Reactive Java persistence based applications development
  8. Reactive Java messaging oriented applications development

## Tools, toolkits, libraries, stacks and frameworks used during the workshop

  1. Java 21.
  2. Quarkus 3.11
  3. Eclipse MicroProfile 6.1 specifications implemented by Quarkus
  4. `java.net` classes for network applications
  5. `java.nio` classes for non-blocking network applications
  6. Netty 4.1 framework for asynchronous event-driven network applications
  7. Eclipse Vert.x 4.5 toolkit for building responsive, resilient, and scalable applications
  8. SmallRye Mutiny library for Java reactive applications
  9. RESTeasy implementation by RedHat of the Jakarta REST specifications
  10. Apache Kafka and AMQP for reactive messaging applications
  11. Minikube as K8S implementation.

## Prerequisites

If you want to run the examples provided or to "hack" along with me, then you'd need:
  1. A developer computer running Linux, MacOS or Windows
  2. Java 21 and Maven 3 installed
  3. Docker or Podman installed
  4. Minikube installed

But if you prefer just listening or taking notes and running the example later, on your own, that's absolutely fine. 
In this case you don't need any particular software or tool.

## Nota Bene

All the applications and, more generally, all the code examples presented during the workshop are prepared in advanced 
and ready to be used. They might be adjusted, in real-time, to more specific use cases, based on the attendees demands. 
They will be all committed to a public GIT repository accessible to the attendees.
