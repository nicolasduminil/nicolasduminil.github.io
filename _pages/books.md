## [50 Shades of Quarkus RESTful Services](https://shorturl.at/pwCfN)

My most recent on Quarkus and RESTful services is available in paperback, hardcover and Kindle format. This booklet is dedicated to software architects and developers who think that the allegedly "no-code" solutions are rubbish and the ML and LLM based tools, while unavoidable nowadays, aren't meant to generate end-to-end code.

What's inside:

  - Historical approach of the RESTful services, from the RPC/Corba/DCOM ancestors, up to date.
  - Quarkus RESTful services basics and annotations.
  - Eclipse MicroProfile implementation by Quarkus.
  - Quarkus Synchronous RESTful services and clients.
  - Quarkus Asynchronous RESTful services and clients.
  - Quarkus Reactive RESTful services and clients.
  - Anatomy of enterprise grade applications.
  - Quarkus microservices based implemntation.
  - Quarkus unit, integration and end-to-end testing.

You don't need to be a Java champion to read this booklet, just be willing to become one. Ready ?
